# What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?

Currently to many people owning a house is one of their important life objectives. Buying a house is one of the good investments one can make. However, most people stumble upon the questions such as “Is it the good time to buy a house?”, “Where should I buy a house as an investment option to make most profits?”. 

To help answer these questions, we will be working on predicting house prices using Machine Learning. Predicting house prices can help individuals to determine the selling price of a house in a particular region and help them to find the right time to buy a home. 

# Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

As an individual interested in owning a house for myself, I feel there are a lot of things one should take into consideration while buying or selling a piece of property. One of the major things are the finances. It is important have an accurate and realistic price prediction to make a decision on whether or not to buy a house during a specific time or region.

# What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
At the end of my analysis, I would like to answer the following questions
-	What could the average price of a x bedroom house at a specific county next year?
-	If I want to purchase a house as an investment option in a range of $xxxxx, where should I buy it such that I could sell with maximum profits?

# Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?

# What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?
I will be analyzing the following units
-	Region name
-	County
-	Average price
-	No. of bedrooms

# What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
I would like to use regression models like Linear regressor, Decision tree Regressor and SVM.

# How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
I would like to use R2 score for train and test sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

# What outcomes do you intend to achieve?
By the end of this analysis, I intend to build a model that predicts the price of houses based on the region they are located in and the size of the house.
